  bio: 'I\'m a driven and curious marketer turned web developer with a passion for quality, scalable code that solves interesting problems. After earning an MA in English lit, I spent 6+ years using my writing and design skills in marketing. After years of toying with the idea of coding, I quit my job as a product marketing manager to see if programming was right for me. Coding clicked. Now, I\'m leveraging my critical thinking and problem solving skills to build cool things. On weekends, you can find me sipping cider in the backyard or YouTubing things like \'How to install a tile floor.\' And, you know, doing all those life things like vacuuming and reconciling the budget.',
  background: 'My dad worked for HP for his entire career as a software engineer helping design printers. When I was younger, he used to say I had a great engineering mind based on how I approached projects and found creative solutions. My freshman year of college, I was torn between engineering and English, and ended up pursuing English, which led to a career in marketing. But marketing has never felt like a natural fit for my skills, and I\'ve always wondered if programming could be right for me. I spent enough years wondering, and now I\'m doing something about it.'
